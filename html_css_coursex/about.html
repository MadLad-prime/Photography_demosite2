        <p class="error">Plumbing is the network of pipes, fixtures, valves, and drains installed in buildings for the distribution of water and the removal of waste.
           It plays an essential role in both residential and commercial structures by ensuring clean water supply and sanitation. The plumbing system typically consists of two subsystems: one that brings freshwater in and another that removes wastewater out. 
           These systems must be properly designed and installed to prevent leaks, clogs, or contamination.</p>

            Modern plumbing incorporates a variety of materials, including copper, PVC, and PEX, each suited for specific applications depending on durability, cost, and local codes. Skilled plumbers are responsible for interpreting blueprints, installing or repairing components, and troubleshooting issues like low water pressure or leaking faucets. Preventative maintenance, such as flushing water heaters and inspecting pipe joints, helps extend the life of plumbing systems and improves efficiency over time.
Aside from functionality, plumbing also affects water conservation and energy efficiency. Innovations such as dual-flush toilets, low-flow showerheads, and tankless water heaters allow buildings to reduce water usage and utility costs. In areas where water resources are limited, sustainable plumbing design is becoming increasingly important. Whether it‚Äôs a simple home renovation or a large-scale infrastructure project, plumbing remains at the heart of comfort, hygiene, and environmental responsibility.
If you're curious, I can show how plumbing concepts tie into coding simulations or smart-home tech! Just say the word. üí°üõ†Ô∏è
